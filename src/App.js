/*
The App component should render markup matching the design.html: the main element,
a header with the h1 and a div with class 'App-list'.

The App component will accept 1 prop, store.

The store prop is an object with 2 keys: lists and allCards.
lists is an array of objects.
allCards is an object where each key is a card's ID and the value is the card
object with a title and content.

You'll be given a dummy STORE object to pass to your App.

The App should render a List component for each of the items in the store.lists array.

Each instance of the List component should be passed 2 props (and a key).
The 2 props are header and cards.
The header prop is a string for the List's header.
The cards prop will be an array of card objects.

You'll need to combine the cardIds array for the list with the allCards object.
